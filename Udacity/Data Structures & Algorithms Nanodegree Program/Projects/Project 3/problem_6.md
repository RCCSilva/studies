# Problem 6

The algorithm starts by creating variables that will store the minimum and maximum numbers. In a single traversal, it validates each value and, if it is greater than the maximum or smaller than the minimum, it updates the corresponding variables. After all the values of the array are verified, it returns the maximum and minimum in a tuple. Given `n` as the array length, it has `O(n)` time complexity and `O(1)` space complexity.
