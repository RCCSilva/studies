A. They are the same, since we have the fallowing condition for the loop: `first <= last`.

B. Because it received the same element for the parameter `x` and `y`. And given that `a ^ a = 0` for every vector of bits, when `inplace_swap(int *a, int *b)` receives the same value for both parameters, it will always return 0.

C. Just need to replace `first <= last` for `first < last`. This small chance stops the loop before reaching the middle value for odd length vectors.4
